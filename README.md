# UCI_Credit_Card_Default
This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.
We are using Logistic Regression for Prediction using machine learning and Keras with 3 layers for prediction using Deep Learning. Since the data has Class imbalance problem hence we will oversample the data using SMOTE and re-run the both models.
